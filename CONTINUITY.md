# Continuity Ledger

- Goal (incl. success criteria): Implement Phase 4 UI fully functional per specs, fix outstanding issues, and wire routes/hooks/tests.
- State: UI directories created under src/app; design tokens + Tailwind config + UI primitives started; UI routes scaffolded (root, dashboard, projects, agents, sessions, task detail); basic client/router wiring added.
- Now: Explain DI, then build missing feature components/hooks and refine route data loading with a service factory.
- Next: Finish feature components, hooks, and add UI tests.
- Working set (files/ids/commands): specs/implementation/phase-4-ui.md; .design-engineer/system.md; src/app/components; src/app/routes; src/app/styles/globals.css; tailwind.config.ts
