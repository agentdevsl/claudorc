# Continuity Ledger

- Goal (incl. success criteria): Align workflow DSL with commands merged into skills; fix tests accordingly, including UI for workflow designer.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Use bun; TS strict; async/await; TDD; Result types; update SPEC_UPDATES.md for spec errors.
- Key decisions: None yet.
- State: Broader test suite run; multiple failures to triage.
- Done: Fixed plan_options migration schema; updated container/sandbox tooling; targeted tests run; full test run revealed workflow-dsl command-related failures.
- Now: Triage failing tests from full run.
- Next: Identify root causes and fix failing tests.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED): None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands): `bun run test`, `/Users/simon.lynch/.local/share/opencode/tool-output/tool_c0224b3a6001xa5LOZ3DSm3Ae3`.
