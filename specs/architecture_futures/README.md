# Architecture Futures

This directory contains documentation for planned architectural improvements and enhancements that have been identified but deferred for future implementation.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [durable-streams-enhancements.md](./durable-streams-enhancements.md) | Improvements identified during durable-streams PR review |

## Purpose

When conducting code reviews, architectural analysis, or implementation work, items are sometimes identified that:
- Are valuable improvements but not blocking for the current work
- Require broader scope or coordination to implement
- Should be tracked for future sprints or releases

Rather than losing these insights, they are documented here with:
- Clear problem descriptions
- Recommended solutions
- Effort estimates
- Priority levels

## Contributing

When adding new future work items:
1. Create a new markdown file with a descriptive name
2. Include the source of the finding (PR review, analysis, etc.)
3. Provide clear problem descriptions and recommended fixes
4. Add effort estimates and priority levels
5. Update this README with a link to the new document
