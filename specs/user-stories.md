# User Stories & Specifications

## User Stories

### Project Management

- As a developer, I want to manage multiple projects so I can switch context between codebases
- As a developer, I want each project to have isolated agents so work doesn't conflict
- As a developer, I want to see all my projects at a glance with their current status
- As a developer, I want to quickly switch projects with a keyboard shortcut (⌘P)

### Task Workflow

- As a developer, I want to review agent work before it's merged so I maintain code quality
- As a developer, I want to approve or reject agent changes with feedback for revisions
- As a developer, I want to drag tasks between columns to control workflow

### Concurrent Agents

- As a developer, I want multiple agents working on different features simultaneously
- As a developer, I want to configure the max concurrent agents per project based on my machine capacity

### Project Isolation

- As a developer, I want each project to have completely separate task queues so work doesn't mix

- As a developer, I want agent events tagged with agentId for traceability

### Agent Configuration

- As a developer, I want to sync agent configuration from a git repository so git is the source of truth
- As a developer, I want to specify a subfolder path within the repo for configuration files (e.g., `.agentpane/` or `.claude/`)
- As a developer, I want configuration changes in git to automatically propagate to running agents
- As a developer, I want to version control agent prompts, tool whitelists, and execution settings alongside my code
- As a developer, I want to override global defaults with repo-specific configuration when present

```text
┌──────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│ Backlog  │ →  │ In Progress │ →  │ Waiting Approval │ →  │ Verified │
└──────────┘    └─────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └──────────┘
     ↓                ↓                     ↓                    ↓
 Task queue      Agent assigned       Review git diff      Merged & done
                 Worktree created     Approve/reject
```

### Column Transitions

| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Backlog          | In Progress      | Drag or auto-assign| Create worktree, start agent    |
| In Progress      | Waiting Approval | Agent completes    | Generate diff, pause agent      |
| Waiting Approval | Verified         | User approves      | Merge branch, cleanup worktree  |
| Waiting Approval | In Progress      | User rejects       | Resume agent with feedback      |

  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Session Schema (Standard Schema)

```typescript
// Multiplexed message types for sessions
const sessionSchema = createStateSchema({
  chunks: { schema: chunkSchema, type: 'chunk' },       // Token streams
  toolCalls: { schema: toolSchema, type: 'tool' },     // Agent tool events
  presence: { schema: presenceSchema, type: 'presence' }, // Who's watching
  terminal: { schema: terminalSchema, type: 'terminal' }, // Interactive I/O
  workflow: { schema: workflowSchema, type: 'workflow' }, // Approval events
});
```

### Agent Events

```typescript
type AgentEvent =
  | { type: 'state:update'; payload: AgentState }
  | { type: 'agent:step'; payload: AgentStep }

```

---

## Concurrency Management

### Default Configuration

- Max 6 concurrent agents per project
- Configurable via project settings
- Queue system for tasks awaiting agent assignment

### Agent Lifecycle

1. Task moves to "In Progress"
2. System checks `canStartAgent(projectId)`
3. If under limit: create worktree, start agent
4. If at limit: task waits in queue
5. When agent completes: next queued task starts

---

## Worktree Lifecycle

### Creation

```bash
1. git worktree add .worktrees/{branch} -b {branch} {baseBranch}
2. cp .env .worktrees/{branch}/.env
3. cd .worktrees/{branch} && bun install
4. Set agent cwd to worktree path
```

### Completion

```text
1. Agent finishes task
2. Generate git diff for review
3. Move task to "Waiting Approval"
4. Pause agent
```

### Merge (on approval)

```bash
1. git add -A && git commit
2. git merge {branch} --no-ff
3. git worktree remove .worktrees/{branch}
4. git worktree prune
```

## Isolation Architecture

### Multi-Layer Isolation

| Layer          | Mechanism                        | Scope              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Filesystem     | Git worktrees + `cwd` scoping    | Per-agent task     |
| Configuration  | Per-worktree `.env` files        | Per-agent env      |
| Process        | Isolated spawn with `maxTurns`   | Per-agent exec     |
| Data           | `projectId` + `sessionId` filter | Per-project        |
| Concurrency    | `maxConcurrentAgents` quota      | Per-project limit  |
| Git State      | Separate branches per feature    | Per-task           |
| Dependencies   | Worktree-local `node_modules/`   | Per-worktree       |
| Events         | Durable Sessions by `agentId`    | Per-agent pub/sub  |
| Security       | Tool whitelist + audit trails    | Per-agent perms    |

### Worktree Directory Structure

```text
project/
├── .git/                     # Shared git state
├── main/                     # Primary worktree
└── .worktrees/               # Agent-specific working directories
    ├── feature-auth/         # Agent 1 isolated workspace
    ├── feature-dashboard/    # Agent 2 isolated workspace
    └── feature-api/          # Agent 3 isolated workspace
```

### Agent Execution Context

```typescript
interface AgentExecutionContext {
  agentId: string;
  taskId: string;
  projectId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  cwd: string;                    // Worktree path
  allowedTools: string[];         // Tool whitelist
  maxTurns: number;               // Execution limit
  env: Record<string, string>;    // Isolated environment
}
```

### Tool Access Control

```typescript
// Per-agent tool whitelist
const agentOptions = {
  allowedTools: ['Read', 'Edit', 'Bash', 'Glob', 'Grep'],
  maxTurns: 50,
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
};

// All tool calls captured for audit
publishAgentStep(agentId, {
  type: 'tool:start',
  tool: input.tool_name,
  input: input.tool_input,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});
```

### Session Data Boundaries

```typescript
// All queries filtered by project context
useQuery(collection, (q) =>
  q.where('projectId', '==', projectId)
   .where('sessionId', '==', sessionId)
);

// Events published to agent-specific stream
streams.publish(`agent:${agentId}`, event);

// Subscribers receive only their subscribed agent's events
client.subscribe(`agent:${agentId}`, callback);
```
