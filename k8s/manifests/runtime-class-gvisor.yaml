# gVisor RuntimeClass for AgentPane Sandboxes
# Enables user-space kernel isolation via gVisor (runsc handler).
# gVisor intercepts application syscalls and services them in user-space,
# providing an additional layer of isolation beyond standard containers.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gVisor must be installed on cluster nodes
#   - The containerd runtime must be configured with the runsc handler
#   - See: https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/
#
# Usage:
#   Referenced by SandboxTemplate when runtimeClassName is set to 'gvisor'
#   in the AgentPane sandbox settings.
